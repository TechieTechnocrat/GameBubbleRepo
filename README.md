# Bubble Game - https://sonal1729.github.io/GameBubbleRepo/

This is a simple bubble game implemented using JavaScript and HTML, SCSS. The objective of the game is to click on hidden bubbles to increase your score within a given time limit. The game randomly generates bubbles of different colors, and each click on a hidden bubble increments the score.

## Gameplay

When you load the game, it generates a specified number of bubbles on the screen. Each bubble is represented by a button element with a unique ID and a randomly generated background color. The bubbles are initially hidden from the player.

To start the game, you need to click on the hidden bubbles as quickly as possible. When you click on a hidden bubble, it becomes visible, and your score increases by one. The score is displayed in real-time on the console.

A countdown timer is also displayed on the screen, showing the remaining time to play the game. Once the timer reaches zero, the game ends, and an alert message is displayed, showing your final score.
